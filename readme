main_1.py = 1 objective function(original v_i)
main_2.py = same as main_1.py
main_3.py = 3 objective maximisation and choosing the min of those

main_1-modified.py = 1 objective function, gen-algo run only once, objective function>0 constraint added
main_3-modified.py = 3 objective maximisation and choosing the min of those, gen-algo run only once, objective function>0 constraint added

main_3-modified-modified.py = 3 objective maximisation and choosing the min of those, gen-algo run only each time, objective function>0 constraint added, Only run in Python3.6. results are determinitic =FINAL CODE

sem_2-main_1.py  = inefficent gen algo, 1 objective function =FINAL CODE
